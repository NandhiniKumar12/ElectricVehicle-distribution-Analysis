# Electric Vehicle Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) data to explore trends, insights, and implications for the adoption of electric vehicles across different regions in the  Washington, United States. The dataset encompasses various attributes related to electric vehicles, including their specifications, registration details, and eligibility for clean fuel programs.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following fields:

- **VIN (1-10)**: Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of the vehicle.
- **County**: The county where the vehicle is registered.
- **City**: The city of registration.
- **State**: The state of registration.
- **Postal Code**: The postal code for the registered location.
- **Model Year**: The year the vehicle model was manufactured.
- **Make**: The manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Tesla, Nissan).
- **Model**: The specific model of the vehicle.
- **Electric Vehicle Type**: Category of the electric vehicle (e.g., battery electric, plug-in hybrid).
- **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility**: Eligibility status for clean fuel vehicle programs.
- **Electric Range**: Maximum range on a full charge (in miles).
- **Base MSRP**: Manufacturer's suggested retail price for the vehicle.
- **Legislative District**: Legislative district of registration.
- **DOL Vehicle ID**: Department of Licensing Vehicle ID.
- **Vehicle Location**: Geographical location of the vehicle.
- **Electric Utility**: Utility company servicing the location.
- **2020 Census Tract**: Census tract of registration.

### Data Format
